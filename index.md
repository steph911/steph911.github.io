﻿﻿﻿﻿# ownCloud 10.3 Quick Start GuideownCloud is open source software for cloud-based collaboration and file synchronization. ownCloud provides a safe, secure, and compliant file synchronization and sharing solution on servers that _you_ control.ownCloud provides the following benefits to any size organization, from a small collaboration team to a large-scale enterprise: - **Security**ownCloud is hosted exclusively on your own private server/cloud so your data is under your control. Additionally, ownCloud provides powerful security features, such as encryption, brute force attack protection, OAuth2 support, and others, to ensure that you have complete control of your data.- **File Synchronization**Store your files in one central location, and access them securely from any device, any time you need them. You can designate one or more local folders that ownCloud automatically synchronizes between devices, or use the web interface to share and edit individual files from any device.- **Collaboration**ownCloud makes it safe and easy to share files with collaborators. You can send password protected links for file sharing, and get notifications on your phone when someone shares something with you.ownCloud’s powerful permission tools allow you to control exactly who can view and edit your files.- **Extensibility**You can extend the functionality of your ownCloud deployment with numerous community driven apps.
